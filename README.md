👋 Hello, fellow coders and curious souls!
I’m a multidisciplinary engineer by day, code whisperer by night. Aspiring to automate everything, from coffee makers to complex workflows—because, honestly, who has time to not automate?

✨ Skills include making code work eventually, commenting only when absolutely necessary, and attempting to debug while caffeinated.
👩‍💻 Currently writing code that (hopefully) won’t need too many patches... yet.

🌍 On a mission to blend engineering, tech, and a bit of magic into something impactful. Here to create, learn, and maybe, just maybe, break fewer things.
